## Steps:

- Open `GrabbatheHut.html`
- Paste in a whole ad response
- See your XML pulled out!
- Copy it to clipboard and test it somewhere.


## TODO:
- Clean up /modularize the code
- Support pulling out all ad responses and their individual transaction objects
- Pretty print the xml coming back
- Support different edge cases
- Error handling
- Be able to test renders from web (for vpaid, vast ad formats)
